Description: 'Splash' <https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash> is a javascript rendering service.
    Itâ€™s a lightweight web browser with an 'HTTP' API, implemented in Python using 'Twisted' 
    and 'QT' and provides some of the core functionality of the 'RSelenium' or 'seleniumPipes'
    R pacakges but with a Java-free footprint. The (twisted) 'QT' reactor is used to make the 
    sever fully asynchronous allowing to take advantage of 'webkit' concurrency via QT main loop. 
    Some of Splash features include the ability to process multiple webpages in parallel; 
    retrieving HTML results and/or take screenshots; disabling images or use Adblock Plus rules 
    to make rendering faster; executing custom JavaScript in page context; getting detailed
    rendering info in HAR format.
