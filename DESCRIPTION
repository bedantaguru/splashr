Description: 'Splash' <https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash> is a 'JavaScript' rendering service.
    Itâ€™s a lightweight web browser with an 'HTTP' API, implemented in 'Python' using 'Twisted' 
    and 'QT' and provides some of the core functionality of the 'RSelenium' or 'seleniumPipes'
    R pacakges in a lightweight footprint. Some of 'Splash' features include the ability to process 
    multiple webpages in parallel; retrieving 'HTML' results and/or take screenshots; disabling 
    images or use 'Adblock Plus' rules to make rendering faster; executing custom 'JavaScript' in 
    page context; getting detailed rendering info in 'HAR' format.
