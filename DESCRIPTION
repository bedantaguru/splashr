Description: 'Splash' <https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash> is a 'JavaScript' rendering service.
    Itâ€™s a lightweight web browser with an 'HTTP' API, implemented in 'Python' using 'Twisted' 
    and 'QT' and provides some of the core functionality of the 'RSelenium' or 'seleniumPipes'
    R pacakges but with a Java-free footprint. The (twisted) 'QT' reactor is used to make the 
    sever fully asynchronous allowing to take advantage of 'webkit' concurrency via 'QT' main loop. 
    Some of 'Splash' features include the ability to process multiple webpages in parallel; 
    retrieving 'HTML' results and/or take screenshots; disabling images or use 'Adblock Plus' rules 
    to make rendering faster; executing custom 'JavaScript' in page context; getting detailed
    rendering info in 'HAR' format.
