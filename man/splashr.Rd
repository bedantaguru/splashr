\title{Tools to Work with the 'Splash' JavaScript Rendering Service}
\description{
'Splash' <https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash> is a javascript rendering service.
Itâ€™s a lightweight web browser with an 'HTTP' API, implemented in Python using
'Twisted'and 'QT' and provides some of the core functionality of the 'RSelenium' or
'seleniumPipes'R pacakges but with a Java-free footprint. The (twisted) 'QT' reactor is
used to make the sever fully asynchronous allowing to take advantage of 'webkit'
concurrency via QT main loop. Some of Splash features include the ability to process
multiple webpages in parallel; retrieving HTML results and/or take screenshots;
disabling images or use Adblock Plus rules to make rendering faster; executing custom
JavaScript in page context; getting detailed rendering info in HAR format.
